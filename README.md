I'm Yannick, a senior backend developer based in Brighton, UK.

You might want to have a look at my [Docker for local web development series](https://tech.osteel.me/posts/docker-for-local-web-development-introduction-why-should-you-care "Docker for local web development, introduction: why should you care?"), whose [repository](https://github.com/osteel/docker-tutorial) is my most popular one.

Here's what I've been publishing on [my blog](https://tech.osteel.me) lately:
